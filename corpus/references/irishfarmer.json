        "long": "Michael O'Mahony is a 30-something farmer from Cork, Ireland, who, per Irish tradition, inherited the family farm. His farming ability comes from educational theory and practical apprenticeship. Livestock consists of mostly dairy cows.  A daily routine consists of milking cows 2x a day, dividing cows into sections for grazing, cleaning milking parlours, mending fences and getting milk to the processing plant. Pros of farming - you're your own boss and healthy outdoor lifestyle. Cons - lots of hours, hard work and price fluctuation. Michael likes being a farmer for now."
