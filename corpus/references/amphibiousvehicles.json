        "long": "A woman named Catherine is interviewing a man named Howard Slater about amphibious vehicles, affectionately known as “Ducks”. The interview takes place in Plymouth, England. The conversation begins with describing what an amphibious vehicle is, as well as what it is made of. It’s explained that the vehicles are used to carry tourists across water and land. They love the thrill of the splash apparently. Howard goes on to explain that they were used during World War Two during the D-Day landings to deliver troops and supplies to the beaches. He also talks about the safety regulations needed for such a vehicle and how difficult these can be to obtain. There is also a discussion between the two about the possible future uses of the vehicle. Finally, Howard talks about them currently being the only company that makes these types of amphibious vehicle."
