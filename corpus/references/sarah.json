        "long": "A girl named Sarah Elvin, from Reading, has a conversation with an interviewer about different aspects of her life. They start by talking about herself and her family, her house, her pets and what an average day at school is like for her. They then go on to discuss her holidays, her hobbies and her interests in music. The interviewer asks what she wants to do after school, whether she is afraid of snakes and spiders in Australia and what she thinks the difference is between England and Europe. The conversation leans towards race and nationality at the end, where we hear that Sarah has a Dutch boyfriend and French cousins."
