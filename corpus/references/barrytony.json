        "long": "Menopause, when women stop producing reproduction hormones, causes physical and emotional problems for many women. Hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, can alleviate many of these problems plus prevent heart attacks and osteoporosis. Studies on HRT are controversial. Two US studies showed an increase in breast cancer and strokes. HRT should be monitored by a gynecologist. There are alternative therapies, but they don't seem to have a major effect. Menopausal women need patience and understanding from family and friends during this difficult period."
