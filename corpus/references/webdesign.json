He used to do contract work and then he decided to start his own web design company. He did it for the amount of control and power he would have over his own company as well as presenting himself with a challenge to start a business. He talks about the company naming and how hard it can be to name a company from scratch. He then discusses the clients and how much freedom they have when designing and creating their own website. He also talks about the problems that present themselves and how they go about fixing them with simple solutions. Finally, he talks about the dangers of overworking himself and how it’s good to take a break every now and again."
