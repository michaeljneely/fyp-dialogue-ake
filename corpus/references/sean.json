        "long": "A boy called Sean, who is originally from Liverpool but now lives in Reading, has a conversation with an interviewer about different parts of his life. They discuss his love of music, especially rock music, and the improvements he made to his own guitar with a heavy metal chain. We learn that he doesn’t get along with his family and that his dad isn’t a part of it. We are also told about his hobbies and how he wants to go to a university next year. We also learn that his mum has a hearing disability and that he is repeating the year because he failed his A levels last year due to a lot of socialising."
