        "short": "This is an interview with Martin, a member of the travelling community, who discusses various issues and difficulties that face the community.",
        "medium": "Martin, the interviewee, discusses the policies enforced by the government in an effort to protect traveller rights. He also talks about some of the legislation in place to protect traveller rights and the awareness events being held to promote a greater integration of the community with the settled community.",
        "long": "Valerie, the interviewer, discusses the role of the government in protecting members of the travelling community from racism, infringement of their rights and discrimination in Ireland. Many of the problems encountered by travellers is the lack of awareness between who they really are as people and the prejudices imposed on them by the settled community. The interviewer discusses some of their traditional customs such as marriage and match-making, which often occurs at a young age and their contribution to Irish traditional music, sport and horse fairs."
