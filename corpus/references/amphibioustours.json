It involves tourists riding an amphibious vehicle which drives through historic Plymouth and then motors around the harbor on water. Highlights include Europe's largest naval base, home to Sir Francis Drake, and the departure of the ship Mayflower. The tour is interesting, unique, fun, and because its vehicle is federally regulated, very safe."
