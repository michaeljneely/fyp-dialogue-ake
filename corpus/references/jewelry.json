        "medium": "A girl called Karen introduces herself to the interviewer, who’s name is Valerie. Karen works in a Jewellery shop part time. They discuss various topics about the shop, including tourists and sales. Karen hopes to own her own store one day.",
        "long": "Karen, a part-time jewellery sales assistant is having an interview with a girl named Valerie. Karen talks about what it is like to work in a jewellery store and how annoying it can be when she has to clean the glass in the store day after day due to parents bringing in their children with dirty and sticky fingers. She tells Valerie a funny story involving an American tourist and a door knob. They talk about a boy who bought an expensive gift for his girlfriend and how they broke up the following week. His girlfriend came in to the store and wanted to return it to give him the money back, but they couldn’t because it was engraved on the back. Valerie asks Karen if she does the book-keeping in the store to which Karen’s reply is no. However, Karen does tell her that if the book doesn’t add up, it is usually one of the three family members who works there that has taken the money to pay the bills and hasn’t left a note recording that. She also mentions wanting to own her own store one day but that she will need a lot of money to do it. Finally, she talks about how the store is still busy regardless of the recession as people are still getting engaged and married and that working in as a jeweller is a good profession to be in."
