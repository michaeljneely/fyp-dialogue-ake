# Hello

This final year project is concerned with the research and development of a model to summarize spontaneous dialog between two or more parties. A thorough examination of the domain characteristics and challenges associated with interpersonal conversations will be conducted to define an appropriate baseline system, which will be evaluated on several test collections and compared against the performance of existing models.
